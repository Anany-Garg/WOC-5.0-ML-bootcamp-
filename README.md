#WOC-5.0-ML-bootcamp-
I am Anany Garg. This my code for WOC 5.0 Machine Learning Division. In every folder it contains .ipynb Code files which contains the implementation of the said ML algorithms and it also contains an output csv that was generated by model trained on the given training dataset on the test dataset file which is the output file for the test dataset given to us. There is also the Project report for that. Tech stack used were Google Collab notebook and python programming language.
